# Role-Based Authorization in Jenkins

This document outlines the Role-Based Authorization setup in Jenkins, detailing the **Global Roles**, **Item Roles**, and **Agent Roles**, along with their respective assignments.

## **1. Global Roles**

### **Roles and Permissions**
1. **Admin**:
   - Full administrative access to Jenkins.
   - Can configure global settings, manage roles, and perform all operations.

2. **Developer**:
   - Permissions to manage and execute jobs related to development tasks.
   - Limited access to other configurations.

3. **Tester**:
   - Permissions to manage and execute jobs related to testing tasks.
   - Restricted access outside the testing scope.

### **User Assignments**
| **User**         | **Assigned Role** |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| `developer-1`    | Developer         |
| `admin`          | Admin             |
| `tester-user`    | Tester            |

## **2. Item Roles**

### **Roles and Patterns**
Item roles define access permissions for specific jobs based on naming patterns.

1. **dev-jobs**:
   - Pattern: `dev-.*`
   - Grants access to all jobs starting with `dev-`.

2. **tester-jobs**:
   - Pattern: `test-1`
   - Grants access to a specific job named `test-1`.

### **User Assignments**
| **User**         | **Assigned Role** |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| `developer-1`    | dev-jobs          |
| `tester-user`    | tester-jobs       |

---

## **3. Agent Roles**

### **Roles and Patterns**
Agent roles define permissions for managing Jenkins nodes and agents.

1. **agent-manager**:
   - Pattern: `node.*`
   - Grants access to all agents with names matching the pattern `node.*`.

### **User Assignments**
| **User**         | **Assigned Role** |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| `agent-admin`    | agent-manager     |

## **Summary of Role Assignments**

### **Global Roles**
- `developer-1` → Developer
- `admin` → Admin
- `tester-user` → Tester

### **Item Roles**
- `developer-1` → dev-jobs
- `tester-user` → tester-jobs

### **Agent Roles**
- `agent-admin` → agent-manager

## **How to Configure Role-Based Authorization in Jenkins**

1. **Install Role-Based Authorization Plugin**:
   - Go to **Manage Jenkins** → **Manage Plugins**.
   - Search for **Role-Based Authorization Strategy** and install it.

2. **Enable Role-Based Authorization**:
   - Go to **Manage Jenkins** → **Configure Global Security**.
   - Select **Role-Based Authorization Strategy** and save the changes.

3. **Define Roles**:
   - Go to **Manage Jenkins** → **Manage and Assign Roles** → **Manage Roles**.
   - Create roles for Global, Item, and Agent scopes:
     - Assign permissions for each role based on your requirements.

4. **Assign Roles to Users**:
   - Go to **Manage Jenkins** → **Manage and Assign Roles** → **Assign Roles**.
   - Assign the appropriate roles to users in Global, Item, and Agent scopes.

## **Best Practices for Role-Based Authorization**

1. **Least Privilege Principle**:
   - Assign only the necessary permissions to each role to minimize risks.

2. **Use Naming Patterns**:
   - Use consistent naming conventions for jobs and agents to simplify role-based access management.

3. **Regular Audits**:
   - Periodically review role assignments and permissions to ensure compliance with security policies.

4. **Documentation**:
   - Maintain clear documentation of roles, permissions, and user assignments for future reference.

## **Conclusion**

Role-Based Authorization in Jenkins provides a flexible and secure way to manage user permissions. By defining roles and assigning them to users, you can ensure that each user has access to only the resources and operations relevant to their responsibilities.
